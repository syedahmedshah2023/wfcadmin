# wfcadmin

## 🚀 Overview  
**wfcadmin** is a web application built to visualise and manage time-attendance data from large CSV (or similarly structured) datasets.  
It enables administrators to upload, parse, view, and analyse employee time logs in a performant, user-friendly interface.

## 📋 Features  
- Upload large CSV files containing time-attendance entries.  
- Efficient parsing and processing of large datasets.  
- Web UI to view, filter and search attendance records.  
- Basic analytics (e.g., total hours, absence/late flags) support.  
- Modular architecture: backend written in Python (Django) + frontend for UI.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- CSV handling large-scale datasets (optimsed file processing).
